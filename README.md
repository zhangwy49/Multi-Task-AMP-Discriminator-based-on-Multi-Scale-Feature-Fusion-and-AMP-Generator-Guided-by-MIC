# Multi Task AMP Discriminator based on Multi Scale Feature Fusion and AMP Generator Guided by MIC
### This framework includes 2 parts:  
**AMP-Hunter** (a multi-task discriminator that fuses convolutional neural networks with graph neural networks) in AMP classification and MIC predictiontask.  
**AMP-Forge** (a generator that integrates multi sequence alignment method to select original candidates) and is guided by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to optimize sequences.
